## !!! keep in mind, this is using the british API. this will most likely not provide correct information if you live outside of the UK. !!!

to use make sure you have [deno](https://deno.land/) and run with the "unstable" parameter.
only deno.ts currently works. no point in using the other versions.

run command
`deno run --unstable deno.ts`


massive thanks to Vincent#6562 , and Burkino#2324 for helping find the api.
